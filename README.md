# CAHBot
Cards Against Humanity for Discord
I am not the main developer; this repository used to be a fork but the original is gone.

## Installation
- `python3 -m pip install -U yarl==1.4.2`
- `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
- `python3 main.py` to start the bot

## In Discord
- typing `$play` opens a game
- each player has to type `$join` in order to join the game
- run `$begin` when everybody is ready
